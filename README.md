# Tokenface
TokenFace is a totally new crypto-currency, based on proof of identification – Proof of Facebook.
<br>100% of Tokens will be distributed for free.

# How it works
<br>TokenFace is a token developed in Ethereum network and available to all interested. For authentication and prevention of distributing tokens in one hand, the system of Facebook access is used – ProofOfFacebook (POF), i.e., a personal temporary User Access Token, available to every user. 

<br>Those willing to get tokens (FACE) provide their User Access Token to the smart contract, which in its turn verifies it through the Facebook service – Graph API Explorer, and when the verification is successful, it charges Tokens (FACE) on the user’s wallet. For smart contract connection with the Facebook Oraclise service was used. 

<br>For the fast crypto-currency distribution a six-level referral system has been created.

<br>Every purchaser gets 100 Tokens (Face).

# How to get Tokens
To receive token (Face) one should possess an Ethereum wallet with at least small sum on the balance needed to send a request to the contract. For the convenient work use the wallet MetaMask. 

<br>If your MetaMask wallet is customized, log in on the page https://tokenface.org, using your Facebook account. Pay attention to your referral – it is necessary for creating a request for tokens (Face). Wallets, unregistered in smart contract, cannot serve as referral. 

<br>After the payment you will receive Tokens (Face) right after your authenticator verification. TokenFace is not a commercial organization, and a sum offered to be paid by the contract will go for gas, used for the verification and Oriclise services.

<br>In addition, everyone can receive Tokens (Face) by requesting smart contract directly, without using https://tokenface.org. For that, one should have MIST installed, to know a referral wallet and a personal Facebook User Access Token, generated in the personal cabinet FacebookForDevelopers.
